#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
Abstract: This paper proposes ~view::maybe~ a range adaptor that produces a view with cardinality 0 or 1 which adapts nullable types such as ~std::optional~ and pointer to object types.
#+END_ABSTRACT


* Changes
** Changes since R4
*** Use std::uwrap_ref and std::is_reference_wrapper_v
*** Remove conditional ~noexcept~ness

** Changes since R3
*** Always Capture
*** Support reference_wrapper

** Changes since R2
*** Reflects current code as reviewed
*** Nullable concept specification
   Remove Readable as part of the specification, use the useful requirements from Readable
*** Wording for view::maybe as proposed
*** Appendix A: wording for a view_maybe that always captures

** Changes since R1
*** Refer to view::all
   Behavior of capture vs refer is similar to how view::all works over the expression it is given
*** Use wording 'range adaptor object'
   Match current working paper language

** Changes since R0
*** Remove customization point objects
   Removed view::maybe_has_value and view::maybe_value, instead requiring that the nullable type be dereferenceable and contextually convertible to bool.
*** Concept ~Nullable~, for exposition
   Concept Nullable, which is Readable and contextually convertible to bool
*** Capture rvalues by decay copy
   Hold a copy when constructing a view over a nullable rvalue.
*** Remove maybe_view as a specified type
   Introduced two exposition types, one safely holding a copy, the other referring to the nullable

* Before / After Table


* Motivation

In writing range transformation it is useful to be able to lift a nullable value into a view that is either empty or contains the value held by the nullable. The adapter ~view::single~ fills a similar purpose for non-nullable values, lifting a single value into a view, and ~view::empty~ provides a range of no values of a given type. A ~view::maybe~ adaptor also allows nullable values to be treated as ranges when it is otherwise undesirable to make them containers, for example ~std::optional~.

#+begin_src C++
std::vector<std::optional<int>> v{
  std::optional<int>{42},
  std::optional<int>{},
  std::optional<int>{6 * 9}};

auto r = view::join(view::transform(v, view::maybe));

for (auto i : r) {
    std::cout << i; // prints 42 and 54
}
#+end_src

In addition to range transformation pipelines, ~view::maybe~ can be used in range based for loops, allowing the nullable value to not be dereferenced within the body. This is of small value in small examples in contrast to testing the nullable in an if statement, but with longer bodies the dereference is often far away from the test. Often the first line in the body of the ~if~ is naming the dereferenced nullable, and lifting the dereference into the for loop eliminates some boilerplate code, the same way that range based for loops do.

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
{
    auto&& opt = possible_value();
    if (opt) {
        // a few dozen lines ...
        use(*opt); // is *opt OK ?
    }
}

for (auto&& opt : view::maybe(possible_value())) {
    // a few dozen lines ...
    use(opt); // opt is OK
}
#+END_SRC

The view can be on a ~std::reference_wrapper~, allowing the underlying nullable
to be modified:

#+begin_src C++
std::optional o{7};
for (auto&& i : view::maybe(std::ref(o))) {
    i = 9;
    std::cout << "i=" << i << " prints 9\n";
}
std::cout << "o=" << *o << " prints 9\n";
#+end_src
Of course, if the nullable is empty, there is nothing in the view to modify.
#+begin_src C++
auto oe = std::optional<int>{};
for (int i : view::maybe(std::ref(oe)))
    std::cout << "i=" << i << '\n'; // does not print
#+end_src

Converting an optional type into a view can make APIs that return optional types, such a lookup operations, easier to work with in range pipelines.

#+begin_src C++
std::unordered_set<int> set{1, 3, 7, 9};

auto flt = [=](int i) -> std::optional<int> {
    if (set.contains(i))
        return i;
    else
        return {};
};

for (auto i : ranges::iota_view{1, 10} | ranges::view::transform(flt)) {
    for (auto j : view::maybe(i)) {
        for (auto k : ranges::iota_view(0, j))
            std::cout << '\a';
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
}

// Produce 1 ring, 3 rings, 7 rings, and 9 rings
#+end_src

* Proposal
Add a range adaptor object ~view::maybe~, returning a view over a nullable object, capturing by value temporary nullables. A ~Nullable~ object is one that is both contextually convertible to bool and for which the type produced by dereferencing is an equality preserving object. Non void pointers, ~std::optional~, and the proposed ~outcome~ and ~expected~ types all model Nullable. Function pointers do not, as functions are not objects. Iterators do not generally model Nullable, as they are not required to be contextually convertible to bool.

* Design
The basis of the design is to hybridize ~view::single~ and ~view::empty~. If the underlying object claims to hold a value, as determined by checking if the object when converted to bool is true, ~begin~ and ~end~ of the view are equivalent to the address of the held value within the underlying object and one past the underlying object.  If the underlying object does not have a value, ~begin~ and ~end~ return ~nullptr~.

* LEWG Attention
Call LEWG's attention to the use of `ptrdiff_t` as the return type of `size` (which is consistent with `single_view`).
The author has a weak preference for a signed type here, but a strong preference for consistency with other Range types.

* Synopsis
** Maybe View
~view::maybe~ returns a View over a Nullable that is either empty if the nullable is empty, or provides access to the contents of the nullable object.

The name view::maybe denotes a range adaptor object ([range.adaptor.object]). For some subexpression E, the expression view::maybe(E) is expression-equivalent to:

  -- maybe_view{E}, the  View specified below, if the expression is well formed, where decay-copy(E) is moved into the maybe_view

  -- otherwise view::maybe(E) is ill-formed.

[Note: Whenever view::maybe(E) is a valid expression, it is a prvalue whose type models View. — end note ]

** Concept /Nullable/
Types that:

  -- are contextually convertible to bool

  -- are dereferenceable

  -- have const references which are dereferenceable

  -- the iter_reference_t of the type and the iter_reference_t of the const type, will :

      -- satisfy is_lvalue_reference

      -- satisfy is_object when the reference is removed

      -- for const pointers to the referred to types, satisfy ConvertibleTo
model the exposition only Nullable concept

 -- Or are a reference_wrapper around a type that satifies Nullable

Given a value i of type I, I models Nullable only if the expression *i is equality-preserving. [ Note: The expression *i is indirectly required to be valid via the exposition-only dereferenceable concept ([iterator.synopsis]). — end note ]
